# Contributing to yubal

Thanks for your interest in yubal! This document explains how you can help.

## Project Status

yubal is under active solo development and evolving quickly. At this stage, I'm not able to review or merge large feature PRs — they tend to create merge conflicts and review overhead that slow things down.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug:

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/guillevc/yubal/issues) to avoid duplicates
2. Use the latest version to see if the issue has been fixed

When reporting, please include:

- yubal version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant logs or screenshots

[Open a bug report](https://github.com/guillevc/yubal/issues/new)

### Suggesting Features

### Questions & Support

For questions or troubleshooting, [open an issue](https://github.com/guillevc/yubal/issues/new).

### Pull Requests

**What's welcome:**

- Bug fixes
- Typos and documentation improvements
- Small, focused changes

**What to avoid for now:**

- Large feature additions
- Major refactors

If you're unsure whether a PR would be welcome, please open an issue first to discuss.

> **Note:** I prefer to handle feature development myself until the project stabilizes. Feel free to fork for personal use, but please don't expect large PRs to be merged.
